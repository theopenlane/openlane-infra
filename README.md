# Openlane Infrastructure Provisioning

This repository contains Helm charts and scripts designed to provision production-grade GCP infrastructure using a GitOps approach, powered by **GCP Config Controller** (which includes managed Config Sync and **Config Connector**). The infrastructure includes a GKE Autopilot cluster, shared VPC, DNS, Load Balancing (ingress), CloudSQL, and Memorystore Redis.

This setup is designed for **highly automated, declarative infrastructure management**, where desired state is defined in Git and continuously reconciled by Config Sync leveraging Config Connector.


## Architecture Overview

### Inheritance and Structure 

We implement a three-tier inheritance model for configuration. The focus of this approach is configuration inheritance, emphasizing clear separation of concerns, secure-by-default settings, and scalability for a multi-environment, multi-project GCP organization.

The underlying tiers of the structured charts are:

1. Bootstrap Chart (openlane-gcp-bootstrap): 
    * Defines global configurations, folders, organization-level policies, KMS resources, and acts as an orchestrator that dynamically generates ArgoCD Application resources for each specific GCP project.

1. Project Chart (gcp-project): 
    * A reusable blueprint for a single GCP project. It creates the KCC Project resource, enables necessary APIs, sets up project-level IAM, and acts as a parent for specific resource charts deployed within that project.

1. Resource Charts (gcp-gke-cluster, gcp-cloudsql-postgresql, etc.): 
    * Define granular GCP resources (e.g., GKE clusters, BigQuery datasets, Storage buckets) and are deployed as sub-charts of the gcp-project chart.

### Patterns and Practices

This repository follows several key patterns and practices to ensure a robust, scalable, and maintainable infrastructure setup:

* **GCP Foundations Blueprint Alignment:** We aim for strong network segmentation (e.g., separate Shared VPCs for production and non-production), centralized logging, and least-privilege IAM, as recommended by GCP's security best practices.
* **KCC Namespace Mode:** Each GCP Project is mapped to a dedicated Kubernetes Namespace via KCC's Namespace resource. This ensures all KCC resources deployed into that specific Kubernetes Namespace land in the correct GCP Project.
* **ArgoCD App-of-Apps Pattern:** A master ArgoCD Application (root-apps.yaml) orchestrates the deployment of environment-specific bootstrap applications, which in turn generate and manage ArgoCD Applications for each individual GCP project.

### High-level Workflow

With the goal of being able to idempotently re-establish the entire Openlane infrastructure (and as an added benefit the steps others could follow to set up their own Openlane infrastructure), the workflow is as follows:

1.  **Bootstrap Phase (Manual / Scripted):**
    *   An initial GCP Project is created and then enabled with required APIs.
    *   The `bootstrap_config_controller.sh` script is executed to provision a **GCP Config Controller** instance. This service provides a fully managed Kubernetes cluster, pre-installed with Config Sync and Config Connector.
    *   The Config Controller is configured to sync from *this Git repository* pulling from `rendered/<env>/` (e.g., `rendered/dev/` or `rendered/prod/`) where the Helm charts are rendered.
    *   The `rendered/<env>/` directory contains the rendered output of the Helm charts, which are generated using the Openlane CLI tool or Helm CLI directly.
    *   The `configsync/` directory contains the root-sync declarations for each environment (e.g., dev, prod) that Config Sync will use to watch and apply changes.
    *   The `secrets/` directory contains Sealed Secrets files, which are encrypted secrets that can be safely stored in Git and decrypted by the Config Controller.

2.  **Infrastructure Deployment (via Config Sync and Config Connector):**
    *   Once synced, **Config Sync** automatically applies the Helm charts (which declare **Config Connector Custom Resources**) from this repository to the Config Controller's Kubernetes API.
    *   **Config Connector**, running within the Config Controller, observes these CRs and provisions the corresponding GCP resources (VPC, GKE, CloudSQL, DNS, LB, Redis) in the target GCP projects.
    *   Any changes pushed to the Git repository are automatically detected and reconciled by Config Sync, keeping your GCP infrastructure in sync with your Git definitions.

3.  **Application Deployment (via ArgoCD):**
    *   **ArgoCD** is deployed onto the **Config Controller cluster**. It acts as a Kubernetes-native GitOps tool for managing application deployments.
    *   ArgoCD is configured to monitor a separate Git repository (e.g., `theopenlane/openlane-application`) containing the application's Kubernetes manifests.
    *   ArgoCD then deploys the Openlane application to the provisioned **Workload GKE Autopilot cluster**.

You're right, that's a much cleaner and more user-friendly way to present the information! Hyperlinking the chart name directly to its README simplifies navigation.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

1.  **GCP Account and Project:** A GCP project where you have `owner` or equivalent permissions. This project will implicitly become your "management" project, hosting the Config Controller.
2.  **GCP Billing Account:** A billing account linked to your GCP project.
3.  **Local Tools:**
    *   `gcloud CLI`: Authenticated and configured
    *   `helm`: For linting/templating charts
    *   `kubectl`: For interacting with Kubernetes clusters
    *   `go-task`: The task runner used in this project
    *   **Clone this repository:** `git clone https://github.com/theopenlane/openlane-infra.git` and `cd openlane-infra`.
4.  **Git Repository for Config Sync:** This repository should be accessible by Config Sync. If it's private, you'll need to follow GCP's documentation to configure authentication. For a public repo, no extra steps are needed.

## Chart Scaffolding

The repository includes a custom shell script (`openlane-chart.sh`) to scaffold new charts. This tool automates the process of:

- Creating a new Helm chart
- Removing default templates
- Updating `Chart.yaml` with dependency details (including optional alias support)
- Rendering default values and external templates
- Building Helm dependencies
- Generating documentation with helm-docs

Example usage:

```bash
./scripts/openlane-chart.sh create 
  --name my-new-chart 
  --dependency-url https://charts.example.com 
  --dependency-chart-name example-chart 
  --dependency-chart-version 1.2.3 
  --dependency-alias exchart
```

### Linting and Testing

We use [Chart Testing](https://github.com/helm/chart-testing) to ensure our charts follow best practices. To lint a chart, run eitehr:

```
task lint
```
or

```bash
docker run --rm -it -w /charts -v $(pwd)/../:/charts quay.io/helmpack/chart-testing:v3.12.0 ct lint --charts /charts/charts/<chart-name> --config /charts/charts/<chart-name>/ct.yaml
```

### Documentation Generation

Documentation is automatically generated from chart annotations using helm-docs. To manually generate documentation:

```bash
task 
```
