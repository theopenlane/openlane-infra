## Update documentation

Each of the charts in this repository has a `README.md` which contains chart-specific instructions or information (non-templated information) and additionally a `HELM.md`. This allows all the benefits of templating to be used in the `HELM.md` while still allowing for chart-specific documentation to be added and not be overridden. The general goal is that all the charts share the same templating configuration so that global functionality / updates can be made and applied to all charts rather than individually managing each chart's documentation via the templating mechanisms.

Chart documentation in the `HELM.md` is generated with [helm-docs](https://github.com/norwoodj/helm-docs) from `values.yaml` file.

After file modification, regenerate README.md with command:

```bash
task docs
```

OR if you want to attempt to run it without task, you can use optionally use the docker image although there is no stock Task provided for this:

```bash
docker run --rm -it -v $(pwd):/helm --workdir /helm jnorwood/helm-docs:v1.14.2 helm-docs
```

Globally updating all charts' documentation can be done by running the following command from the root of the repository:

```bash
task docs
```

## Run linter

To run the linter on this chart, you can use the `ct` tool. This will check for common issues in the chart and ensure it adheres to best practices. You can also run Helm's `lint` and for convenience, the task command below runs both `ct lint` and `helm lint` commands. You can run them individually if you prefer via `task lint:ct` and `task lint:helm`.

You can run both linters with the following command:

```bash
task lint
```

OR if you'd like to run the ct lint process by using a docker image, you can use a command like the following:

```bash
docker run --rm -it -w /charts -v $(pwd)/../../:/charts quay.io/helmpack/chart-testing:v3.12.0 ct lint --charts /charts/charts/openlane-gcp-service-account --config /charts/charts/openlane-gcp-service-account/ct.yaml
```
